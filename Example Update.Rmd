This is a response rate update for `r format(Sys.Date(), "%m/%d/%Y")`.  There are currently `r sum(df$n)` responses to the survey.  

## Responses by school  

```{r}

tmp <- df %>% 
  group_by(school) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n))

kable(tmp)

```

## Responses by date for each school  

```{r}

ggplot(df) +
  geom_line(aes(x=EndDate, y=Responses, group=school, color=school)) +
  theme_minimal()
```
